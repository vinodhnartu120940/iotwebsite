                        <li>Maintain optimum shade (60%) with 2 tier mixed shade. It is advisable to not take up any shade regulation during the March & April months. In case of any necessity in specific blocks, only shade dressing/lifting may be taken up after receipt of adequate showers preferably, during the end of May or in June.</li>
                        <li>Tracing of infested plants should be completed by the end of March and end of September to avoid the emergence of adult borers from infested plants.</li>
                        <li>During the tracing operation, the severely infested plants with multiple infestations need to be uprooted and destroyed immediately by burning or killing the stages inside the stem by dipping in water for 10 days.</li>
                        <li>The less infested or suspected plants (infested) can be saved by wrapping the main stem and thick primaries with strips of non-woven fabrics (>1 mm thickness). This method prevents the emergence of adult beetles from infested plants and thereby preventing further spread of the infestation. Sometimes the wrapped plants would also recover if the infestation was in the early stage.</li>
                        <li>To protect the remaining healthy plants one of the following measures should be carried out without fail by the end of March and September to prevent egg laying.

                                <li>Bark scrubbing: Remove the loose bark on the main stem and thick primaries using a coir glove or coconut husk. Do not use sharp implements for bark scrubbing to avoid injuries to the green tissues.</li>
                                <li>Swab the main stem and thick primaries with 10% lime solution (20 kg spray lime dissolved in 200 L of water along with 200 ml DDL Fevicol) to avoid egg laying.</li>

                    <li>Coffee is processed either by wet method to produce 'Plantation / parchment coffee' or by dry method to obtain 'Cherry coffee'.</li>
                    <li>For preparation of both these types of coffee, picking of just ripe fruits is essential.</li>
                    <li>Over ripe or green (unripe) berries result in poor cup quality after processing. If, for any reason coffee could not be harvested as and when it ripens, the over ripe and green fruits should be sorted out and processed separately as 'cherry'.</li>
                    <li>The pulper, washing machines, tank, vat, trays etc., should be kept clean.</li>

                    <h5>Organic Coffees in India</h5>
                    <p>Organic coffee are those coffees produced by such management practices which help to conserve or enhance soil structure, resilience and fertility by applying cultivation practices that use only non-synthetic nutrients and plant protection methods. Further, although many producers grow coffee without use of synthetic agro-chemicals, this passive approach is not sufficient to be considered organic in the absence of credible certification by an accredited certification agency.</p>
        
                    <h5>Global Production</h5>
                    <p>Organic coffee is being produced by about 40 countries in the world with major production share coming from Peru, Ethiopia, and Mexico. Organic coffee is chiefly consumed in Europe, the US, and Japan. According to the US Organic Trade Association, the global sales of organic coffee reached 67,000 MT in 2006, recording a 56% increase from 2003 when approximately 42,000 MT were exported. In the United States alone, organic coffee sales amounted to approximately $110 million in 2006, an increase of 24% from the previous year. Organic coffee products are now marketed in the form of regular, decaffeinated, flavored, and instant coffee as well as in other foods like ice-creams, yogurt, sodas, candies, and chocolate-covered beans, etc.</p>
        
                    <h5>Scope for Organic Coffee Production in India</h5>
                    <p>There is a good potential for the production of organic coffee in India, as the conditions are far more favorable than in any other coffee-producing country. Some of the natural advantages in India are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Coffee is mainly cultivated in deep fertile jungle soils under a two-tier mixed shade canopy comprising of evergreen leguminous and non-leguminous shade trees. Growing under shade has several advantages. Shade trees provide a natural habitat for a vast population of birds and natural enemies of insect pests/diseases, help in reducing soil erosion, contribute towards the fertility of coffee soils by recycling nutrients from deep soil in the form of leaf litter, and finally protect the coffee bushes from vagaries of changing weather conditions.</li>
                        <li>Traditional farming practices such as the use of cattle manure, composting, manual weeding, etc., are in vogue in the vast majority of small holdings.</li>
                        <li>Availability of sufficient skilled manpower for labor-intensive operations like manual weeding, shade regulation, and soil conservation measures, etc.</li>
                        <li>The horticultural practices followed in Indian coffee plantations are considered as one of the best in the world, in which emphasis is mainly towards manipulation of microclimate and plant health, so as to reduce excessive dependence on agrochemical inputs.</li>
                    </ul>
        
                    <h5>Current Status and Growth Constraints</h5>
                    <p>Apart from these natural advantages, the Indian coffee industry is characterized by predominantly small holdings. Majority of these small holdings especially in Idukki zone of Kerala, Bodinayakanur zone of Tamil Nadu and all the tribal holdings in Andhra Pradesh and the North-Eastern states are basically organic by default. These small and tribal coffee growers do not use chemical fertilizers and plant protection chemicals due to their poor economic status and due to their belief in natural farming. Consequently, the yields are low and are only at subsistence levels. Thus, there exists a good scope for converting these small and tribal holdings into certified organic without much change in the existing cultivation practices.</p>
                    <p>Despite good potential, the organic coffee is grown only in about 2,600 ha in the country with an estimated production of about 1700 MT as on 2007. The major area is in Tamil Nadu and Kerala followed by Karnataka (see database on organic coffee producers Certified organic coffee holdings in India - 2008).</p>
                    <p>The growth of the organic coffee sector in India is not very encouraging despite the fact that the conditions here are ideally suitable for organic coffee production. Some of the constraints identified are as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Many smallholder groups, especially in Kerala, have opted for organic farming during the great coffee price crisis period 1999-2003 mainly to reduce cost of inputs. But unfortunately, majority of the area was Robusta coffee, which is not very much preferred in the international market.</li>
                        <li>The quality of coffee produced by smallholder groups was often not up to the expectation of specialty coffee market.</li>
                        <li>The agencies which were behind the formation of smallholder groups also did not possess necessary marketing skills to promote their certified product in the International market.</li>
                        <li>During the late 1990s, organic coffee were fetching a good premium in the international market. But the premiums started narrowing down to about 15% in recent years. Considering the disadvantage Indian coffee faces with regard to the logistics to the main organic coffee importer i.e., USA the premiums are not very attractive for Indian organic coffee.</li>
                        <li>From 2004 onwards, coffee prices remained attractive and prices offered in the regular market are high enough for the producers to sell their produce at farm gate rather than in the export market.</li>
                    </ul>
        
                    <h5>Success Stories</h5>
                    <p>Despite the slow growth, some of the producers of organic coffee especially in the medium and large grower category have been successful in realizing high premiums in the international market for their organic coffee. This is because of their constant efforts in improving the quality of coffees as well as marketing. Even in the case of smallholder groups, organic farming has offered good benefits through attractive premiums for pepper, vanilla, etc., which are grown as intercrops in their coffee holdings.</p>
        
                    <h5>Support from Coffee Board</h5>
                    <p>Coffee Board has developed a package of practices for organic coffee production based on field experiments, surveys, and case studies. The Board has also brought out various publications on organic farming from time to time. The important ones are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Technical documents on Package of Practices for organic coffee</li>
                        <li>Guidelines on production of organic coffee</li>
                        <li>Permitted inputs to control pests and disease in organic coffee estates</li>
                        <li>Guidelines for production of organic coffee</li>
                        <li>Know-how about organic coffee certification</li>
                        <li>Composting of coffee wastes</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These publications can be obtained from the Assistant Librarian, Central Coffee Research Institute, Coffee Research Station Post, Chikmagalur- 577 117, India.</p>
        
                    <h5>The National Programme On Organic Production (NPOP)</h5>
                    <p>During the 1990s, the Government of India initiated the process of developing a national policy on organic agriculture and putting in place the production standards to encourage production and export of organic agricultural products from the country. The initiative was spearheaded by the Ministry of Commerce & Industry. The Commodity Boards functioning under the Ministry were actively involved in developing the national policy and standards on organic agriculture. Accordingly, the National Programme on Organic Production (NPOP) was officially launched in 2000 and notified under FTDR Act in the year 2001.</p>
                    <p>The NPOP was accorded equivalency by the European Union for its regulation on Organic Agriculture EC 2092/91. That means that any product certified according to NPOP can have ready access to European markets without the need for separate EU Certification. The USDA has also recognized the accreditation system adopted by India under NPOP, which means that all the Certification Agencies accredited under NPOP can inspect and certify according to USDA National Organic Programme (NOP) with the need for separate accreditation by USDA. At present there are nearly 20 accredited certification agencies in India.</p>

                    <h5>Methodology of Crop Forecasting/Estimation of Coffee in India</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Prior to liberalization of the coffee market, the crop estimates were fairly accurate owing to mandatory crop returns from estates and periodical information from other sources such as pool agents and curing works.</li>
                        <li>Consequent to dismantling of the pooling system, the only avenue available to the Board is crop estimations through the extension network. Till 2000/01 crop season, forecasts/estimations were carried out by extension officers with respect to their zones, which were then aggregated at zone/district/state levels to arrive at crop estimates. These forecasts were mostly subjective.</li>
                        <li>From the 2001-02 season onwards, crop forecasts have been made more scientific using sampling methods. For the 2001-02 season, the crop forecasts were based on 889 randomly selected estates across different size categories of holdings in 43 coffee zones of traditional coffee-growing areas. To achieve greater accuracy, the sample size was almost doubled to 1500 estates from the 2002-03 season and further increased to 2000 from the 2007-08 season onwards.</li>
                        <li>The current methodology provides for a stratified multi-stage random sampling technique with the size of the estates (holding size) in each zone. In this sampling framework, the basic strata of the population are the species of coffee (arabica or robusta) and the size of the holdings (with nine categories).</li>
                        <li>To maintain the proportionality of strata of the population, the samples in each of the strata were drawn following the Population Proportion to Size (PPS) criteria, which, in this case, is the proportion of planted area across different zones and holding size categories.</li>
                        <li>From each zone and each specified category, the required number of sample estates are drawn randomly. It is ensured that these samples are distributed fairly well across different villages of a zone.</li>
                        <li>Presently, Extension officers are adopting the ‘visual method’ for assessing crop yield after due consideration of the last four years' realized crop, extent of bearing wood, rains during critical stages (Blossom, backing, monsoon), grower opinion, etc.</li>
                        <li>In each of the selected sample estates, forecasts are made three times in a season representing: post-blossom (May-June), post-monsoon (October-November), and final (March-April). Details on yielding area and estimated production are recorded together with other parameters such as rainfall, pest and diseases, etc. Reasons for variations in production between the forecasts are fully accounted for.</li>
                        <li>Production of a particular category in the zone is obtained by multiplying the average productivity of the corresponding category sample estates in that zone with the bearing area under the category. Such production of each size category is then aggregated to arrive at the zonal production. Aggregation is further taken up to the level of 'districts' and states.</li>
                        <li>For the non-traditional areas of Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, and the North Eastern states, the respective zone's official estimates are used.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Hence, the ‘visual method’ of crop estimation is still being followed.</p>
                    <p>The accuracy of crop estimates depends on two factors: the estimation methodology and the database on the extent of area under different varieties and categories of holdings. There is a need to update the data on the coffee area by a detailed census to reduce the degree of error in crop estimates.</p>
                    <p>You may please forward your comments and suggestions on this subject along with forecast, if any, to:</p>
